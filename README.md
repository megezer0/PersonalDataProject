My ChatGPT Conversations Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze my ChatGPT usage to uncover patterns, topics, and trends, and to visualize these insights.

There is no specific hypothesis for now. However, here are some research questions:
  1. In which topics, I need help of ChatGPT?/What are the most common topics I discuss with ChatGPT, and how do they change over time?
  2. How does my usage intensity vary across different time periods (daily, weekly, or during key life events)?
     - For example, how my usage increase when I have a midterm soon?
  4. How is my attitude towards ChatGPT?
  5. Does ChatGPT increase my productivity?

I will mostly use chatLogs (in .html format) and conversations (in .json format).

Currently, I am searching about which tools/ML models I can use for text topic analysis.

My plan for visalization, except basic EDA graphs, is to create a mix of Bubble Chart and Network Connection. Each bubble will represent a word, size of the bubble will depend on the total usage and each bubble will show a list of the dates that it is used(Interactively, when cursor is on the bubble). Each bubble will be connected to the words that are also used in the same conversation or topic. Each topic will be represented by a different colour.

Optionally, I may present all the visualized data on a website, but it is like a further step.
