My ChatGPT Conversations Data Analysis

In this project I will explore how, why, when etc. I use ChatGPT using the datasets I imported directly from its website. I will mostly use chatLogs (in .html format) and conversations (in .json format).

My main plan is to do a topic analysis on chats, visualize words used in these chats by their usage frequency and used dates/times. 

There is no specific hypothesis for now. However, here are some research questions:
  1. In which topics, I need help of ChatGPT?
  2. How are the topics we talk about are correlated to my real life experience?(For example, how my usage increase when I have a midterm soon?)
  3. How is my attitude towards ChatGPT?

My plan for visalization, except basic EDA graphs, is to create a mix of Bubble Chart and Network Connection. Each bubble will represent a word, size of the bubble will depend on the total usage and each bubble will show a list of the dates that it is used(Interactively, when cursor is on the bubble). Each bubble will be connected to the words that are also used in the same conversation or topic. Each topic will be represented by a different colour.

Optionally, I may present all the visualized data on a website.
